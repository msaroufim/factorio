# factorio-rl

Side project trying to turn factorio into an RL environment. Core idea will be to 
1. Make a custom factorio mod
2. Figure out a way to map python code to lua code so its more familiar with ml people
3. Find a good way of encoding the environment
4. Hook up a toy RL training loop
5. Stream on twitch??

I did not get very far and am still doing hello worldy stuff
